High priority
- FAQ and CHANGELOG should be in CVS, with automatic update to the web site.
- Define a default font for Latin1 languages.
- Registration on search engines. We will need to define relevant keywords and translated them.
- Link section in Support page. Exchanging links is the only way of getting high results on search engines like Google.
- Website translation status.


Done
- Expose pgadmin3 TODO.txtt and BUGS.txt to the users, so they can be checked and referenced for bug reporting.
- Compilation howto for both pgAdmin and wxGTK2ud 2.5. Otherwise, developpers will contact us with a "I can't compile pgAdmin using wxGTK2.4"...
- Link to the Artistic licence.
- Use PostgreSQL php class to generate the list of mirrors.
- Translation howto including "getting started" and "guidelines" sections.
- Team members.
