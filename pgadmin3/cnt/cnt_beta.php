The pgAdmin Development Team are pleased to announce the first Beta
version of pgAdmin III v1.2.0, the well-known GUI administration tool
for the PostgreSQL database system.

This first beta release of v1.2.0 addresses many bugfixes some of them
which were really annoying ones:
<ul>
<li>crashes when connecting to a MULE_INTERNAL encoded database
<li>crashes in certain conditions while using the SQL query window
<li>cursor disappearing when changing windows focus
</ul>
You can find a complete list of fixed issues 
<A HREF="support.php#bugs">here</A>.<br>
</p>
<p>
Many enhancements have also been integrated into pgAdmin III, including:
<ul>
<li>extended server status display, showing lock status and log files
<li>Grant wizard for easy application of privileges to multiple objects
<li>control of local server processes
<li>database backup and restore
<li>export query output to local files
<li>greatly enhanced font handling
<li>full support of PostgreSQL 8.0 objects and SQL syntax
</ul>
You can find detailed download instructions at the
<a href="download.php">Download</A> page.<br>
</p>
<p>
(At the time of this writing, source tarball, Win32 and Slackware binaries should be available on one of your favourite PostgreSQL mirror, Debian GNU/Linux binaries are about to be uploaded and binaries for other platforms are being built).<br>
</p>
<p>
It's been about 9 months since latest stable release and The Development
Team would like to thank all the hackers, port maintainers, translators
and testers that have given up their time to help with the development
of pgAdmin III.<br>
</p>
<p>
As this is a beta release, there are almost certainly bugs to be found. The first of these (a bug in the keyword quoting code) has already been found and fixed thanks to user feedback. The more you can find, the better the final release will be - so let the hunt begin!<br>
</p>
<p>
Please, give it a try and report any/all problems to <A href="mailto:pgadmin-support@postgresql.org">pgadmin-support@postgresql.org</A>.<br>
</p>
<p>

Happy Bug Hunting!
