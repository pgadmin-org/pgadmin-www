<dl>
  <dt>Why promote pgAdmin?</dt>
  <dd>Promoting free software is essential for economical development and civil liberties.
  PostgreSQL and pgAdmin free software are used worldwide by a large number of end-users, companies, governments and institutions. Therefore, helping us promote pgAdmin is certainly not a loss of time.
  </dd>
 <dd>
  On the long run, reaching new users can help pgAdmin project get in touch with talented developers, who will in turn bring exciting new features to pgAdmin and possibly to PostgreSQL too.
  </dd>

    <dt>Promotion strategies</dt>
  <dd>
        The proposed strategy is quite simple :
        <ul>
          <li>Try to register pgAdmin on free software web site in your country. We are highly interested in community websites designed by 'opinion leaders'. For example, Troels Arvin registered pgAdmin on Freshmeat <a href='http://freshmeat.net/projects/pgadmin3/?topic_id=68'>here</a>. Each country has one or two major websites for free software.
          <li>Contact the press and write short articles about pgAdmin (if you are bold enough!). Whever you are contacted by journalists, we can help write a short article.
          <li>Analyse the <a href='http://www.pgadmin.org/stats/webalizer/'>statistics</a> of pgAdmin3 website in your country, which reflect the overall interest in pgAdmin. Some countries have a real interest in pgAdmin, like the Russian Federation or Brazil. 
        </ul>
